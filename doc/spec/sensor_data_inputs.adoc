**Prefix**

Sensor data inputs shall be named with the following prefix:

[source]
----
OSMPSensorDataIn
----

**Rules**

* If only one sensor data input is configured, the prefix shall only be `OSMPSensorDataIn`.
* If more than one sensor data input is configured, the prefix shall be extended by an array index, for example, `OSMPSensorDataIn[1]` and `OSMPSensorDataIn[2]`.
* Array indices shall start at 1 and shall be consecutive.
* Each sensor data input shall be defined as a notional discrete binary input variable with `@causality="input"` and `@variability="discrete"`.
* The MIME type of the variable shall specify the `type="SensorData"` as part of the MIME type parameters.
* Sensor data shall be encoded as `osi3::SensorData`.
* The guaranteed lifetime of the sensor data protocol-buffer pointer provided as input to the FMU shall be from the time of the call to `fmi2SetInteger` that provides those values until the end of the following `fmi2DoStep` call.
